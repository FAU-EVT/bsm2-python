### Introduction

Primary clarifier

### Model

The model proposed by Otterpohl and Freund (1992) and Otterpohl et al. (1994) can be described by one
completely mixed tank and a separation of the effluent of the tank into a primary clarifier effluent and a primary
sludge (Figure 4). The model description originally does not consider primary sludge. The formulas regarding
primary sludge are added by simple mass balance considerations. Table 9 summarizes the variables and their
assumed values.
